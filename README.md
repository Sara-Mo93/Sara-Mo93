### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Sara, welcome to my profile. I recently completed a software development Bootcamp with the School of Code. During the bootcamp we worked on the entire development journey of digital products, from UX/UI, project management to programming. 

I am motivated by creating valuable customer focused products and would like to pursue a career in Product Management.
